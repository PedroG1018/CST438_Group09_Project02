### Project Description

The website allows users to create virtual wishlists where they can add items of their choosing for future reference. Users can modify their own lists, modify their items, and delete their lists and items. An admin can view all registered users and delete their accounts. This is all done using a REST API and a persistence database layer to store user, list, and item information that will be shared across the pages where necessary.

Deployed using Heroku: https://vast-beach-99467.herokuapp.com
